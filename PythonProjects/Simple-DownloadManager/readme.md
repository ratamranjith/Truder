Simple Download Manager:
	I have created this download manager for downloading the local files from Jenkins. Because, normal browser download took more time and sometimes browser will be getting freezed.
	In order to eliminiate the problem, found a simple solution and it worked a lot.
	Download manager are prohibited in most of the companies.
    I have created this as a workaround in 2022.
