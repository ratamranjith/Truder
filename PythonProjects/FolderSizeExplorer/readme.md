# Folder Size Explorer

* Whenever we encounter a problem, we strive to find a solution by designing, implementing, and optimizing it. Similarly, I recently faced an issue regarding determining the size of each folder. I was given a three-day deadline to collect the folder sizes and input the data into an Excel sheet.

* As the shared folder is dynamic, new folders are occasionally created, and in some cases, existing ones may be deleted. To prevent misleading data in the sheet, I devised an idea to retrieve the folder sizes using Python.
